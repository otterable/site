The idea for an ermine e-bike was birthed out of my own needs. There wasn't a bike The issues being:

* High purchase costs
* Incovenience of rentals (having to return bikes to a station, not being able to take it home) 
* Market-wide speed limit of 25 km/h (no matter how "luxurious" bike you purchase, it has the exactly same specs LOL)
* Low wattage

So, I created my own solution. With a cute otter on it.

If you are also bothered by lack of options on the market, feel free to consider my alternative.
